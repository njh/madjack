What is MadJACK ?
-----------------

MadJACK is a MPEG Audio Deck for the Jack Audio Connection Kit with 
an OSC based control interface. It was written as a backend for DJ 
music playback and is released under the GPL licence.

It aims to achieve the following:
 - Lightweight
 - Talk natively to JACK
 - Easy to script / remote control
 - High Quality audio
 - Skip free playback
 - Responsive / Low Latency
 - Reliable / Not Crash

It does not do the following:
 - Have pitch control on playback (yet!)
 - Decode metadata/ID3 tags
 - Queue up multiple tracks
 - Have playlists

In order to segue and cross-fade between tracks I have multiple 
copies of MadJACK running.
