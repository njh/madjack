What is MadJACK ?
-----------------

MadJACK is a MPEG Audio Deck for the Jack Audio Connection Kit.
It was written as a backend for DJ music playback.

It aims to achieve the following:
 - Talk natively to JACK
 - Easy to script / remote control
 - High Quality audio
 - Skip free playback
 - Responsive / Low Latency
 - Reliable / Not Crash

It does not do the following:
 - Decode metadata/ID3 tags
 - Queue up multiple tracks
 - Have playlists

In order to segue and cross-fade between tracks I have multiple 
copies of MadJACK running.
